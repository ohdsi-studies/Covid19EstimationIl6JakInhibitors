Description: IL-6 and JAK inhibitors are being considered for use in treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in rapid clinical trials across the world. However, the full safety profiles of these drugs is unknown, and the current trials are unlikely to be powered or have sufficient follow-up time to evaluate most safety outcomes. The aim of this OHDSI study is to use existing retrospective data to evaluate the safety of IL-6 and JAK inhibitors, using the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design.
